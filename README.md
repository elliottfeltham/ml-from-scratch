# ML from scratch

Practicing building fundamental machine learning models without using popular libraries such as Pytorch
and Tensorflow which abstract away many of the steps.

## Libraries

I will however be using these libraries to make the models more performant and to anaylse data:

```
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

scikit-learn is useful for working with the data.
